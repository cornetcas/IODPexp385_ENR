This folder contains the files used to run the SAMBA workflow ( https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/samba ) on 16S-rRNA raw reads from the IODP expedition 385 sediment incubations, to produce a broad range of statistical information alongside a phyloseq object ( https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/ ) used for downstream analysis in R-studio ( https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio ).
